1. Kafka logs are divided in partitions and distributed among the different kafka nodes so there is no unique node that stores all logs.
2. Zookeeper was substituted by kafka Quorum in the 2.8 version.
3. Retention configuration ensures that messages are stored during a specific period of time.
4. Group-Id of a message does ensure that it is distributed to a certain set of consumers of the same group.

Correct statements: Group-Id ensures the messages are distributed to associated consumers

## Question 2

Topic replication provides reliability and availability.
Topic partitioning provides reliability and availability.

Group id is a way to load balance the messages.

Topic partitioning supports scaling.
Consumer grop id supports scaling.
